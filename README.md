# Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning–based system for **binary classification of brain MRI images** into **tumor** and **no tumor** categories.  
The project was developed as part of the *Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning* coursework and demonstrates both a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and a **transfer learning approach using ResNet50**.

## 📌 Problem Overview
Brain tumor detection from MRI scans is a critical task in medical image analysis. Manual diagnosis is time-consuming and depends heavily on expert interpretation. This project explores how deep learning models can assist in automatically identifying tumor presence from grayscale MRI images.
